# Overview

## Research interests

My research is motivated by the spectacular organismal diversity across the tree of life and aims at **understanding how phenotypic variation emerges and how it is maintained** in spatially or temporally variable environments. I am using a variety of study systems spanning different levels of ecological organization (populations / communities / ecosystems) to investigate interactions within species, between species, and environmental effects as drivers of phenotypic diversification. 
{% include gallery id="study_systems" %}
Specifically, I am interested in how evolutionary trajectories are affected by the interplay of natural selection and phenotypic plasticity - especially during juvenile development and by selection for combinations of traits. Understanding the role of developmental plasticity and complex selection patterns on correlated characters is key to understanding the formation and maintenance of phenotypic variation in a broader evolutionary context. 
**<center>My overarching research goal is to trace causality behind phenotypic variation <br> within a phenomics framework using high resolution data.</center>**

## Research projects

I address my research questions using both outdoor and laboratory experiments, but I also use existing datasets to study the factors that shape phenotypic evolution. To collect high dimensional phenotypic data in high throughtput I use automated image analysis: computer vision is a versatile and efficient method for phenomics, allowing us to overcome manual image processing as a longstanding analytical bottleneck in ecology and evolution.

			It took less than 15000 years for several hundred species of haplochromine cichlid species to evolve from a common ancestor within Lake Victoria. I am using computer vision to construct a classifier to map fossil teeth onto teeth from contemporary trophic guilds to investigate the speed and order of their emergence.

In a series of large scale outdoor experiments we quantified ecosystem effects of macrophytes using cutting-edge high frequency measurement technology.
