# Foundation species and the stability of aquatic ecosystems
---

Ecosystems worldwide are affected by an increasing frequency of external perturbations, like extreme climate events, invasive species, or altered nutrient dynamics. However, we still know surprisingly little about the factors that drive the temporal dynamics of ecosystems and affect resistance and resilience to perturbations. To address this I investigate how key features of aquatic ecosystems (e.g. macrophytes) affect temporal dynamics of ecosystems, and their resistance to press (fish addition) and pulse (nutrient addition) perturbations. I use high resolution sensor technology to meter a variety of parameters in highly replicated experimental mesocosm and pond ecosystems.
