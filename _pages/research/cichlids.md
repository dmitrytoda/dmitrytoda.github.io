# Reconstructing the trophic radiation of Lake Victoria Cichlids
---

I am using a combination of classic Machine Learning (shape features) and Deep Learning to construct a classifier that will help to map fossil teeth found in sediment cores onto contemporary trophic guilds. Using the temporal information from the sediment cores, as well as other data about the ancient lake communities, we are hoping to learn more about this adaptive radiation, which is among one of the most rapid cases of adaptive evolution.
