# Research interests

My research is motivated by the spectacular organismal diversity across the tree of life and aims at **understanding how phenotypic variation emerges and how it is maintained** in spatially or temporally variable environments. I have worked on a variety of study systems, investigating how phenotypic diversification is driven by species interactions with con- and heterospecifics and with their environment.

For my work I conduct outdoor and laboratory experiments to study the factors that shape phenotypes within different levels of ecological organization (populations / communities / ecosystems). Specifically, I am interested in how evolutionary trajectories are affected by the **interplay of natural selection and phenotypic plasticity**, especially during juvenile development, and by selection for combinations of traits.

Understanding the role of developmental plasticity, as well as complex selection patterns on correlated characters, is key to understanding the formation and maintenance of phenotypic variation in a broader evolutionary context. Therefore, one of **my overarching research goals is to trace causality behind phenotypic variation within a phenomics framework**, for which we need high resolution phenotypic data.

I am developing computer vision tools to collect **phenotypic data in high resolution and with high throughput** and to help removing image analysis as a longstanding analytical bottleneck in ecology and evolution. With the resulting high dimensional phenotypic data, I am hoping to uncover the role of constraints, tradeoffs and evolvability in complex phenotypes, and to specify causal relationships between phenotypic, molecular, and environmental data.
