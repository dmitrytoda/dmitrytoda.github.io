One of my guilty pleasures is translating from Classical Chinese, which is to modern Chinese what Latin is to modern Romance languages like French and Spanish. I translate mostly into my mother's tongue with is Russian, but you will see an English translation here and there too. I do not aim to create a proper poetical interpretation but rather to accurately transmit the meaning and the emotions of the original.
