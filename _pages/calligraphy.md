# My artwork

I started learning Chinese brush calligraphy in March 2020 under [teacher Xu](http://yellowpages.superlife.ca/yellowpagesclassify/richmond-hill-arts-studio-%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E4%B9%A6%E6%B3%95%E5%9B%BD%E7%94%BB%E8%AF%BE%E7%A8%8B%E6%8B%9B%E7%94%9F/) (许老师), following the curriculum of China Academy of Art (中国美术学院）.

## Mountain road 山行
This is a work with ink on rice paper, done in 曹全碑 style of clerical script (隶书) on Jan 9, 2020. The translations are mine, close to literal and not aimed at being poetic.

		The road keeps climbing to mountains, rocky and cold
		Between the white clouds there are people's houses
		I stop the carriage to enjoy the beauty of maples at night
		The frosty leaves are more red than April flowers

# Deep learning for Chinese calligraphy

On one side, Chinese calligraphy is very simple: it all comes down to black-and-white images. On the other, it is incredibly complex, as the beauty of even a single character is defined by many parameters that are hard to define in a formal way: 

1. Each stroke can be written in many ways, with the main features being:
	* thickness and its gradient along the stroke
	* direction (tilt)
	* curvature
	* head shape (square or round)
	* dry or wet (how much ink went into it)
2. Relative positions and proportions between strokes may vary
3. Connections between strokes: can be unconnected, solid connection (实接) or loose connection (虚接)
4. Any given character can be written tall or wide
5. Different parts of it can be allotted different amount of space

A skilled calligrapher can write one character in 10-20 different ways (within the same style!) that will be aesthetically pleasing. And of course, a less skilled person may write it with any number of mistakes, making it less pretty.

This combination of simplicity and richness makes calligraphy an exciting and challenging field for deep learning.

## State of the art

Unsuprisingly, Chinese researchers were the first ones to apply deep learning techniques to their national art. Here are a few academic papers that show what has been done already:

1. [Style recognition](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2016/report/ChenSuLi-Machine%20Learning%20for%20Different%20Calligraphy%20Style%20Recognition-report.pdf). Chinese calligraphy comes in 5 main styles, or scripts. The authors compared several algorithms by how well they can distinguish between those styles.
2. [Cursive calligraphy recognition](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334380107_Applying_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_to_Cursive_Chinese_Calligraphy_Recognition). Cursive style or 草书 can be difficult to read even by native Chinese speakers; the author aims at doing this task by a deep CNN as a variant of handwritten text recognition.
3. [Evaluating brush movements](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2018/0146.pdf). The authors aim at creating an machine calligraphy teacher that will compare video of brush movements of a student with those of a human teacher.
