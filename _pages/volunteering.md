# PMI Mega-workshops

PMI (Project Management Institute) is the leading non-profit professional organization for project management. PMP (Project Management Professional) exam, introduced in 1984, remains the most sought-after PM certification and a gold standard for the industry, with over 1 million active certificate holders in 214 countries and territories worldwide as of 2020.

One thing that maintains the high credibility of PMP for employers is that exam questions are constantly being developed by peer project practicioners, that is, it is the global PM community itself that defines the standard of its members.

After getting my own PMP credential in 2014, I was invited by PMI to take part in the regular exam development workshops as volunteer SME (subject matter expert), and worked on three of them:

* Santiago, Chile, 2016
* Macau SAR, China, 2019
* Accra, Ghana, 2020
