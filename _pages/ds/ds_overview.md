In 2007, when I got my degree in Applied Mathematics from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT), artificial intelligence was still more of a concept than a working industry. It took over a decade of managing software development projects in finance, e-commerce and online gaming before I discovered my passion for data science and building machine learning systems with my own hands.

* **Tools**: Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib), R (data.table, ggplot2, caret), SQL
* **Algorithms**: prediction and classification, SVM, KNN, PCA, random forest, gradient boosting, ensembling, time series analysis, recommender systems, anomaly detection
* **Deep learning**
	- CNN: image classification, object localization, object detection, landmark finding, face recognition
	- RNN: GRU, LSTM, word embeddings, attention models, trigger word detection
	- Technology: TensorFlow, Keras
* **Statistical inference**: hypothesis testing, regression models

Some projects that I've done:
