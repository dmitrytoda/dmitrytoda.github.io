# Overview

## Project management

I actually did a lot, like a lot of project management: waterfall, agile and so on. @@ Insert a good overview here

## Portfolio

@@ Here come all the projects I've managed.

			<div class="txt-box">
			The common bluetail damselfly (<i>Ischnura elegans</i>) exhibits unusuably stable female-limited colour polymorphisms. I am investigating signals of correlational selection on colouration and morphology in response to balancing selection and environmental conditions within and across different Swedish populations.

		<h3>Trophic diversification of Lake Victoria Cichlids</h3>
		<div class="container-inner">
			<img class="img-prev" src="/assets/images/cichlid_teeth.png">
			<div class="txt-box">
			It took less than 15000 years for several hundred species of haplochromine cichlid species to evolve from a common ancestor within Lake Victoria. I am using computer vision to construct a classifier to map fossil teeth onto teeth from contemporary trophic guilds to investigate the speed and order of their emergence.

		<h3>Determinants of temporal variability in aquatic ecosystem</h3>
		<div class="container-inner">
			<img class="img-prev" src="/assets/images/experiments/ponds1.jpg">
			<div class="txt-box">
			Submerged macrophytes are important foundation species that can influence the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems over time and govern the response to perturbation. In a series of large scale outdoor experiments we quantified ecosystem effects of macrophytes using cutting-edge high frequency measurement technology.
