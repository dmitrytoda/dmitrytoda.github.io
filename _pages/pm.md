# Career overview

I dedicated a full decade of my life to project management, starting from 2011. That includes 4 years in Russia, 2 in Chile and 4 in Canada, spanning finance, consulting, e-commerce and online gaming industries. I led dream teams of up to 20 software engineers, business analysts, architects, designers and QA, with annual budgets reaching $4 million and timelines from one month to one and half years. My management style is often a mix of classic waterfall with Agile approaches.

Before that, I worked as business analyst and analysis team leader for another 3 years, doing consulting for investement management at Accenture and OSS (operation support systems) for Tier-1 telecommunication providers at NetCracker.

I hold PSM (Professional Scrum Master) and PMP (Project Management Professional) certifications. Giving back to the PM community, I take part in PMP exam development workshops as volunteer SME (subject matter expert).
