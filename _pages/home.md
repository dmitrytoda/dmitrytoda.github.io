Welcome to my homepage!

I am an evolutionary ecologist broadly interested in the forces that shape phenotypic evolution; including species interactions, phenotypic plasticity and developmental effects. 

Funded by two fellowships, I am currently working as a postdoc in the Svensson lab at Lund University. Here, in the Evolutionary Ecology unit of the Department of Biology, I am investigating the adaptive landscape of sexual polymorphisms and the phenomics of sexual conflict in odonates (damselflies and dragonflies). 

To quantify sexual polymorphisms and phenotypic variation within and among populations I am using high throughput computer vision. With the resulting high dimensional phenotypic data, I am hoping to uncover the role of constraints, tradeoffs and evolvability in complex phenotypes, and to specify causal relationships between phenotypic, molecular, and environmental data.
