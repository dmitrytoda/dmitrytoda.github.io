Before coming to Lund I worked as a short term (0.5 year) postdoc in Ole Seehausen's lab at Eawag Kastanienbaum, where I supported investigations of the evolutionary past of Lake Victoria Cichlids using **[computer vision](https://mluerig.github.io/phenopype/example_8_cichlid_teeth.html){:target="_blank"}**.

Between 2015 and 2019 I completed my PhD in Blake Matthews' lab at Eawag Kastanienbaum under co-supervision from Jukka Jokela, funded by ETH ZÃ¼rich's Center for **[Adaptation to a Changing Environment](https://adaptation.ethz.ch/){:target="_blank"}**. For my thesis, I conducted a series of experiments to explore the role of different types of species interactions within different levels of ecological organization and across a range of ecological contexts. An electronic copy of my thesis can be downloaded **[>>here<<](https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/eawag/islandora/object/eawag%3A19819){:target="_blank"}**.

I received both of my undergrad degrees from the University of Oldenburg: I did my Bachelors thesis with **[Andreas Kunzmann](https://www.leibniz-zmt.de/de/tropenforschung/organisation/wissenschaftliche-abteilungen-struktur/oekologie/ag-experimentelle-aquakultur.html){:target="_blank"}** at the Center for Tropical Marine Ecology in Bremen, Germany, where I investigated the effect of multiple stressors on scleractinian corals. I then went abroad abroad to California for my Masters thesis, to investigate coexistence patterns of seasgrass mesograzers in the **[Stachowicz lab](https://stachlab.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"}** at Bodega Marie Laboratory, UC-Davis.
