After 6 years of wordpress and 1.5 years of half-assed GH-pages attempts, I have finally gotten around to implement my new website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Feels like reaching a safe haven. In the end, wordpress felt extremely cumbersome to maintain, with a bloated browser based CMS and - despite dozens of plugins - still only little control of my site's appearance. With a combination of [GH-pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the wonderfully simplistic [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme, I feel more motivated again to keep an updated web-presence to communicate science, tech and other things that I feel deserve a presence. Good to be back :-).
